## üîÄ Agent Workflows

### CrewAI-Based Workflow

The CrewAI system uses a team of specialized agents:
1. **Job Analyzer**: Analyzes job descriptions to extract requirements
2. **Candidate Screener**: Evaluates candidates against job requirements
3. **Interview Planner**: Designs interview processes and questions
4. **Scheduler**: Coordinates interview logistics

### LangGraph-Based Workflow

The LangGraph system implements a stateful workflow:
1. **Job Analysis**: Analyzes job requirements and creates ideal profiles
2. **Candidate Screening**: Evaluates and ranks candidates
3. **Interview Planning**: Creates structured interview rounds
4. **Scheduling**: Generates optimal interview schedules

## üìä Sample Usage

### Creating a Job Posting

```python
import requests

job_data = {
    "job_role_name": "Senior Software Engineer",
    "job_description": "We are looking for a Senior Software Engineer...",
    "years_of_experience_needed": "5+ years",
    "location": "Remote"
}

response = requests.post("http://localhost:8000/jobs/", json=job_data)
print(response.json())
```

### Shortlisting Candidates

```python
import requests

shortlist_data = {
    "job_id": "job-123",
    "number_of_candidates": 5,
    "number_of_rounds": 3
}

response = requests.post("http://localhost:8000/shortlist/", json=shortlist_data)
print(response.json())
```
